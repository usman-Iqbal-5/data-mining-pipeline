# üß¨ Data Mining Pipeline for B-Cell Epitope Prediction in *Trypanosoma cruzi*

### Using CRISP-DM: Machine Learning, EDA, Preprocessing, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning & Evaluation

This project presents a computational pipeline developed in **Python** for predicting B-cell epitopes in *Trypanosoma cruzi*, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. The work follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology and incorporates a range of data mining techniques from exploratory data analysis to final model deployment.

## üìà Overview of the CRISP-DM Pipeline

**CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** was used as the guiding methodology:

* ‚úÖ **Business Understanding** ‚Äì Define the goal: predict potential B-cell epitopes in *T. cruzi* proteins.
* üìä **Data Understanding** ‚Äì Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a high-dimensional biological dataset.
* üßπ **Data Preparation** ‚Äì Clean, scale, balance, and reduce dimensionality using both filter and embedded feature selection methods.
* ü§ñ **Modeling** ‚Äì Train and evaluate machine learning models.
* üß™ **Evaluation** ‚Äì Compare model performance using multiple metrics.
* üöÄ **Deployment** ‚Äì Final pipeline applied to protein data for epitope prediction.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

* Conducted **comprehensive EDA** to uncover patterns, data distribution, and class imbalance.
* Cleaned data, handled missing values, scaled features, and applied multiple class balancing techniques:

  * **Undersampling**, **Oversampling**, and **SMOTE**.

### üß† Feature Selection

To improve model performance and reduce overfitting in this high-dimensional dataset, feature selection was performed using both **filter** and **embedded** methods:

#### ‚úÖ Filter Method ‚Äì Information Gain

* **Information Gain** was computed for each feature relative to the target variable (epitope/non-epitope).
* The top 10 most informative features were selected for initial model training.

#### ‚úÖ Embedded Method ‚Äì Random Forest Feature Importance

* A **Random Forest classifier** was trained and its built-in feature importance scores were used to evaluate the contribution of each feature.
* The top 15 features were identified, based on how much they helped differentiate between the classes.

These selected features were used to:

* Reduce computational complexity
* Improve training time
* Enhance model interpretability
* Maintain or improve prediction performance

## ü§ñ Model Development

* Built and tested several ML algorithms:

  * **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Artificial Neural Network**.
* Evaluated models using:

  * **Balanced Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **Recall**
  * **F1-Score**
